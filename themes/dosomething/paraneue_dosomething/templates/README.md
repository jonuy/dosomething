Templates
=========

Place tpl files inside this directory if you need to override them.


Campaign
--------

The campaign directory is for Campaign entity specific files.  The campaign.tpl.php file 
is used for the "action" view mode, which is the default view mode for viewing a campaign.
The campaign--pitch.tpl.php file is used for the "pitch" view mode.  Both of these tpl files
have been copied from the entity.tpl.php file, in the Entity contrib module.
