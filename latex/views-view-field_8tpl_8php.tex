\subsection{Detailed Description}
This template is used to print a single field in a \hyperlink{classview}{view}.

It is not actually used in default Views, as this is registered as a theme function which has better performance. For single overrides, the template is perfectly okay.

Variables available:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \$view: The \hyperlink{classview}{view} object
\item \$field: The field handler object that can process the input
\item \$row: The raw SQL result that can be used
\item \$output: The processed output that will normally be used.
\end{DoxyItemize}

When fetching output from the \$row, this construct should be used: \$data = \$row-\/$>$\{\$field-\/$>$field\_\-alias\}

The above will guarantee that you'll always get the correct data, regardless of any changes in the aliasing that might happen if the \hyperlink{classview}{view} is modified.
