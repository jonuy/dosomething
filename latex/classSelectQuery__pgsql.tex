Overrides \hyperlink{classSelectQuery_a32ede93f2abfd7f8bc388d0c00512fae}{SelectQuery::orderBy()}.

PostgreSQL adheres strictly to the SQL-\/92 standard and requires that when using DISTINCT or GROUP BY conditions, fields and expressions that are ordered on also need to be selected. This is a best effort implementation to handle the cases that can be automated by adding the field if it is not yet selected.


\begin{DoxyCode}
   $query = db_select('node', 'n');
   $query->join('node_revision', 'nr', 'n.vid = nr.vid');
   $query
     ->distinct()
     ->fields('n')
     ->orderBy('timestamp');
\end{DoxyCode}


In this query, it is not possible (without relying on the schema) to know whether timestamp belongs to node\_\-revisions and needs to be added or belongs to node and is already selected. Queries like this will need to be corrected in the original query by adding an explicit call to \hyperlink{classSelectQuery_a8f5cef012b0f3111a5e6b8bcc47bacea}{SelectQuery::addField()} or \hyperlink{classSelectQuery_ab240a4ee46566adaff68b364c7c60699}{SelectQuery::fields()}.

Since this has a small performance impact, both by the additional processing in this function and in the database that needs to return the additional fields, this is done as an override instead of implementing it directly in \hyperlink{classSelectQuery_a32ede93f2abfd7f8bc388d0c00512fae}{SelectQuery::orderBy()}. 

Reimplemented from \hyperlink{classSelectQuery_a32ede93f2abfd7f8bc388d0c00512fae}{SelectQuery}.\hypertarget{classSelectQuery__pgsql_a2aac16a64fec955bf8313aabdcad0fec}{

\label{classSelectQuery__pgsql_a2aac16a64fec955bf8313aabdcad0fec}
Orders the result set by a random value.

This may be stacked with other \hyperlink{classSelectQuery__pgsql_adb1134a3498b05b32a33787418d68f8c}{orderBy()} calls. If so, the query will order by each specified field, including this one, in the order called. Although this method may be called multiple times on the same query, doing so is not particularly useful.

Note: The method used by most drivers may not scale to very large result sets. If you need to work with extremely large data sets, you may create your own database driver by subclassing off of an existing driver and implementing your own randomization mechanism. See

\href{http://jan.kneschke.de/projects/mysql/order-by-rand/}{\tt http://jan.kneschke.de/projects/mysql/order-\/by-\/rand/}

for an example of such an alternate sorting mechanism.
